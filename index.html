  <a id="id.overview"></a> <h3>Overview</h3>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>What is the Automated Traffic Enforcement Equity (ATEquity) Pilot? </strong></summary>
			<p>In 2023, Mayor Bowser launched a <a href="https://dmoi.dc.gov/atetaskforce" target="_blank">Task Force on Automated Traffic Enforcement Equity and Safety</a>. The Task Force recommended that the District launch 
an income-based fine pilot program to learn about the potential impact on safety and equity.</p>  
			<p>The ATEquity Pilot is an effort by DC Government to offer reduced fines to income-eligible vehicle owners. Vehicle owners with eligible tickets who are enrolled in SNAP (food stamps) can apply to have their fine 
reduced by a lottery. The District will evaluate the pilot’s impact on having the fine sent to collections and on getting citations in the future. The findings may inform how DC's traffic fines are structured in the 
future.</p> 
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Why is DC Government offering fine reductions by a lottery?</strong></summary>
		  <p>In selecting tickets to receive fine reductions by a lottery, we can compare outcomes for those who received a fine reduction and those who didn't. This will help us learn what might happen if income-based traffic 
fines were available to anyone in DC.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Who should I contact if I have questions about the ATEquity Pilot?</strong></summary>
		  <p>If you don’t see the answer on this page, call 311, and follow the steps below: </p>
          <ul><li>Press 3 for the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) related services;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>Press 1 for ticket-related information; and</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>Press 0 to speak with a call taker trained to answer questions about the ATE Equity Fine Reduction pilot.</li></ul>		 
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>  
          <summary><strong>I have questions about Automated Traffic Enforcement (ATE) in DC. Where can I learn more?</strong></summary>
		  <p>You can visit the <a href="https://ate.ddot.dc.gov/pages/faq" target="_blank">ATE hub</a> on the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) website to find answers to frequently asked questions about ATE in DC.

<a id="id.eligibility"></a> <h3>Eligibility</h3>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Who is the ATEquity Pilot for?</strong></summary>
		  <p>Households who receive SNAP (food stamps) from DC have the chance to get <b>one eligible camera ticket</b> reduced by half in the ATEquity Pilot. Your photo enforcement ticket meets the criteria if it is:</p>	  
          <ul><li>$100 or less;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>mailed fewer than 30 days ago;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>issued to a DC-registered vehicle;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>not yet <a href="https://dmv.dc.gov/service/how-contest-ticket" target="_blank">contested</a>; and</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>not yet paid.</li></ul>
		  <p>Parking and officer-issued tickets are NOT eligible.</p>
		  <p>Because households may only get <b>one ticket reduced</b>, eligible households that apply more than once will only be entered into the lottery once.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Why do I need to be receiving SNAP to enter the lottery?</strong></summary>
          <p>Households receiving SNAP in DC need to have a certain level of income. Proof of SNAP enrollment will help the District ensure that fine reductions go to income-eligible households during the pilot.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Where do I find my proof of benefits to show that I receive SNAP?</strong></summary>
          <p>You can access your proof of benefits <a href="https://surveygizmolibrary.s3.amazonaws.com/library/495376/DDMA_ProofofBenefitsFunctionality_V1.pdf" target="_blank">on your phone</a> or <a href=
"https://surveygizmolibrary.s3.amazonaws.com/library/495376/DDRP_ProofofBenefitsFunctionality_V1.pdf" target="_blank">on your computer</a>.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Is my ticket eligible to enter the lottery?</strong></summary>
		  <p>Your ticket is eligible to enter the lottery if it is:</p>
          <ul><li>$100 or less;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>mailed fewer than 30 days ago;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>issued to a DC-registered vehicle;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>not yet <a href="https://dmv.dc.gov/service/how-contest-ticket" target="_blank">contested</a>; and</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>not yet paid.</li></ul>
		  <p>Parking and officer-issued tickets are NOT eligible.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>If someone I live with receives SNAP, am I eligible?</strong></summary>
          <p>You are eligible if you live in a household that receives SNAP. If you’re not sure, check whether your name is listed on the recipient’s proof of benefits. They can access their proof of benefits <a href=
"https://surveygizmolibrary.s3.amazonaws.com/library/495376/DDMA_ProofofBenefitsFunctionality_V1.pdf" target="_blank">on their phone</a> or <a href=
"https://surveygizmolibrary.s3.amazonaws.com/library/495376/DDRP_ProofofBenefitsFunctionality_V1.pdf" target="_blank">on their computer</a>.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>What if I receive Medicaid or TANF but not SNAP? Am I eligible?</strong></summary>
          <p>If you receive Medicaid or TANF but not SNAP, you are not eligible for the ATEquity Pilot.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Can I enter the lottery more than once?</strong></summary>
		  <p>No, you are only eligible if your household has NOT already entered the lottery for the ATEquity Pilot. This means that everyone who enters gets one chance, making it more fair for everyone.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>I got a message that I’m not eligible to enter the lottery. Why not?</strong></summary>
		  <p>You may be ineligible because:</p>
          <ul><li>you've already paid, contested, or scheduled a hearing for this ticket;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>you or someone in your household has already entered this or another ticket into the lottery;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>you answered that you do not want to proceed with the application given that if you were selected you would no longer be able to contest your ticket;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>your ticket amount due is more than $100;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>your ticket was mailed more than 30 days before you applied; or</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>your ticket was issued to a vehicle registered outside of DC.</li></ul>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>If I am not eligible for the lottery, what are my other options?</strong></summary>
		  <p>If you are not eligible for the ATEquity Pilot, you have three other options to respond to the ticket:</p>
          <ul><li>You may <a href="https://dmv.dc.gov/node/1119626" target="_blank">pay your ticket</a>.</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>If you think your ticket was issued in error, you may <a href="https://dmv.dc.gov/node/1119647" target="_blank">contest it</a> and request a dismissal.</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>You can <a href="https://dmv.dc.gov/node/1119637" target="_blank">admit with explanation</a> to try to dismiss the fines and/or penalties.</li></ul>
      </details>
<br>
	  <details>
		  <summary><strong>Is my ticket eligible for the lottery if someone else in my household has already submitted a ticket for another vehicle?</strong></summary>
		  <p>No, your ticket is not eligible for the lottery if someone else in your household has submitted a ticket for another vehicle. Each household is limited to one entry, regardless of the number of vehicles they own.</p>

incomplete form will not save you a spot in the lottery.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>

  <br>
      <details>

      <details>
          <summary><strong>What does it mean to waive my right to contest if I receive a fine reduction?</strong></summary>
		  <p>If you are selected to receive a fine reduction, you are obligated to pay the reduced fine amount. You may not attempt to have your ticket dismissed or reduced further through Adjudication Services at the DC 
Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Why am I asked to provide information about my race, ethnicity, and gender?</strong></summary>
		  <p>This information is optional and not factored into the lottery. If you choose to answer, it will help the District learn as much as possible about who the pilot is serving.</p>
      </details>
<br>
	  <details>
		  <summary><strong>What should I do if I’m having trouble with the application using Safari on iPhone.?</strong></summary>

  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Who decides whether I get a fine reduction?</strong></summary>
		  <p>Fine reductions are given out randomly through a lottery. Because selection is random, there is no process to appeal your lottery selection.</p>

          <summary><strong>How do I know if I was selected to get a fine reduction?</strong></summary>

			</ul>
		  </li></ul>
      </details>
  <br>
