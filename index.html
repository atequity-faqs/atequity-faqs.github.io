  <a id="id.overview"></a> <h3>Overview</h3>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>What is the Income-Based Fine Reduction Pilot Amnesty Program? </strong></summary>
			<p>In 2024, the District’s Automated Traffic Enforcement (ATE) Program increased the number of cameras capturing moving violations from 150 cameras to 477 cameras. As a result of concerns about the effect of the increase in cameras on low-income residents, the Mayor established the Task Force on Automated Traffic Enforcement Equity and Safety.  The purpose of the Task Force was to provide recommendations on the District’s ATE Program and to mitigate against potentially inequitable effects of fines on individuals of varying incomes.  As part of its duties, the Task Force was charged with exploring the feasibility and advisability of a temporary or targeted amnesty program for ATE tickets.  </p>  
			<p> DC Government will use a randomized selection process (that is, a lottery) to reduce certain fines for DC vehicle owners who receive food assistance. Vehicle owners with eligible tickets who are enrolled in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps) can apply to have their fine reduced by half. The evaluation will measure the impact of a fine reduction on getting future tickets and the number of tickets sent to collections with the District’s Central Collections Unit.</p> 
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Why is DC Government using a randomized selection process (a lottery) for this pilot?</strong></summary>
		  <p>By randomly selecting tickets to receive fine reductions, we can compare outcomes for those who received a fine reduction and those who did not. The findings may inform how DC's traffic fines are structured in the future. </p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>How long will the pilot last?</strong></summary>
		  <p>This is a temporary pilot and will end on June 30, 2025 or when funds run out. </p>
      </details>
  <br>
      <details>
          <summary><strong>Who should I contact if I have questions about the pilot?</strong></summary>
		  <p>If you don’t see the answer on this page, call 311, or, if outside the District, call 202-737-4404. Then, follow the steps below: </p>
          <ul><li>Press 3 for the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) related services;</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>Press 1 for ticket-related information; and</li></ul>
		  <ul><li>Press 0 to speak with a call taker trained to answer questions about the Fine Reduction Pilot.</li></ul>

          <summary><strong>Why do I need to be receiving SNAP to be eligible for a fine reduction</strong></summary>
          <p>Households receiving SNAP in DC need to have a certain level of income. Proof of SNAP enrollment will help the District ensure that fine reductions go to income-eligible households during the pilot.</p>
